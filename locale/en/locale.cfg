[mod-setting-description]
rtc:steamtrain-harder-diesel=Removes the default diesel locomotive from the Railway technology and creates a more difficult technology that must be researched to unlock it
rtc:steamtrain-disable=Reverts the functionality of the steam locomotive to match the default diesel locomotive. The tender will function as a cargo wagon. Check if you simply like the look of the locomotive but don't care to change any functionality.
